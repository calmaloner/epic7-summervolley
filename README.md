 I can't play this minigame :sob:  
 So I'll try to use my lack-of-programming skills to make this minigame easier  

### Rather than I felt this

# How to use
Make sure your **Epic Seven** use this settings

Download all files, and run **volley.exe**  
After that you can change delay-per-click if the scripts doesn't run properly  
Delay 1 = delay if ball comes from opponents  
Delay 2 = delay if ball comes from allies  
Then you can let the script run and open your game
